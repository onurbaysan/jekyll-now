# Run bat files as Windows Service with NSSM

I found NSSM on this [StackOverflow link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13294293/343973) when I was searching for a tool to run bat files as windows service. It is really easy to use. I show you a simple usage, just follow the steps below.

### Steps

* Download and extract it
* Open command window in the directory of nssm.exe
* Type ```nssm install SimpleService```
* Set application path and display name for your batch file
* Click Install Service
